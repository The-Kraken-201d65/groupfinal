1. Create a "Test/Dev branch" to prevent merge conflicts with master.
2. Everyone review / approve the test branch prior to a merge. (protect the branch)
3. Test branch has weaker protection, this is meant to safeguard the master. Mistakes can happen in test and its not troublesum
4. Communicate who is working on what. If Matt is on CSS, then the other part of the group should be on something else.
5. Communication is KEY.
6. Morning / Evening huddle to plan and review what overall changes we did. (code review each other)

- Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?:

  We plan to do a morning code review and an evening huddle. We plan to discuss in detail what we did, how can we improve and walk through our code. If someone is staying quiet for a while/not engaging, we need to check in to see if they have anything to contribute. Morning check in, how are we feeling about our project and our goals?

- Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
  We think it is best to resolve the conflict when it happens, either coding or personal conflict. We can all pause what we are doing and focus on the conflict at hand. Talk over any reviews before making changes, the group should be happy with the product not just the individual, we are giving feedback not criticism. Discussing our ideas/opinions openly will help ensure psychological safety. In the event that there is a conflict such as design preferences, we will do a simple vote. If the vote ends up being 2 - 2 we can do a coin toss (with google to be unbaised), whichever is picked from this is the "Preffered outcome" for the group. We can also bring in Nicholas for additional input, but no outside sources will offer solutions/preferences/vote.

- Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. What project management tool will be used?
  We are all happy with using GitHub project. Morning meetings can be a great way to overview what we all need to have completed, talk about who wants to handle what, is anyone falling behind, ect. We plan to work collectively, however, if we run into a problem of needing a project manager we are open to exploring it. We expect to work from 9am to 6pm, given some of us may have appointments or other events taking place. We are also okay with working outside of the expected hours as long as the member stays within his tasks. NEVER work on someone else's code before talking with them and ensuring everyone is okay with that.

- Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  We will have a test branch that we can all merge pr, this will only require 1 person to review. We intend to all work in remo so we can see who has a chance to check out our PR, and we intend to do at least 1 merge per person per day (depending on pair programming). However, a pull request to the master from test will require everyone to review it in a group setting. 

- Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, stand-up times(outside of the ones schedule with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you’re stuck, etc.
  When are we checking in with each other to ensure we are on track.
  9am - 6pm works for all of us, working outside is great with communication.
  Take a break when you need one!
  Stuck after 15mins call a TA, utilize them daily
  Stuck after 5min talk to the group
  Morning meetings / evening huddle
  Pair programming
  Continual positive feedback
