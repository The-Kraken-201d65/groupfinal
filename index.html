        <p>Karen#71: At first I wasn't sure if I would ever need to use an app to help find some destinations on a trip, but this was perfect! Bisita helped me find some locations I never would have heard of!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>JakeFromStateFarm: Bisita is a pretty cool app. It helped me find a really cool lake to visit, but it didn't have any booking options or reservations. You guys should check that out in the future!</p>

        <p>BiggusDikkus: The app is great, but I wish it worked outside of Palawan! I would 10/10 use this the next time I travel somewhere if they update their locations to be in more areas. I liked the heart feature to view my places too!</p>
