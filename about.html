        I'm a software developer with a background in manufacturing management. I picked up programming as a way to improve my efficiency and help my team with repetitive tasks. From there I just kept getting more excited about coding as I learned about the amazing tools people build. I'm looking to join a passionate team where I can put my new skills to work, make some new friends, and contribute to the team's success.

        Hello everyone! I’m Darius Lee Pasilaban. I’m a military veteran who chose to shift into the Tech industry as a software developer. I see the software development industry as a challenging field to work in, it provides flexibility with time and location and is an in-demand industry with good compensation. 

        I also chose the Software Development industry to work in, because aside from the challenges, there’s also a lot of smart people that I can learn from. These challenges and learning from professionals who are smarter than I am, will help my growth to be a better developer and to provide effective and timely software development solutions.
