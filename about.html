        I'm a software developer with a background in manufacturing management. I picked up programming as a way to improve my efficiency and help my team with repetitive tasks. From there I just kept getting more excited about coding as I learned about the amazing tools people build. I'm looking to join a passionate team where I can put my new skills to work, make some new friends, and contribute to the team's success.

        Hello everyone! I’m Darius Lee Pasilaban. I’m a military veteran who chose to shift into the Tech industry as a software developer. I see the software development industry as a challenging field to work in, it provides flexibility with time and location and is an in-demand industry with good compensation. 

        I also chose the Software Development industry to work in, because aside from the challenges, there’s also a lot of smart people that I can learn from. These challenges and learning from professionals who are smarter than I am, will help my growth to be a better developer, and to provide effective and timely software development solutions.

        My name is Jae and I'm currently enrolled at CodeFellows studying software development. My background is in IT support and IT application, but I always had a passion for developing new software, even though I have no experience in writing codes. My goal after completing CodeFellows is to seek employment for a big corporation where I can collaborate with others and utilized what I learned and apply them in real life software projects. Im passionate, goal-driven, and highly motivated to start my new journey.

        Welcome everyone, I’m Matthew Petersen. I’m a Software Developer with a background in military police. I decided to do a shift in careers because I wanted a more challenging but rewarding career and career in which I could make my own path. I chose programming because I knew nothing about it other than it was a skill that could be learned and Seattle has a growing tech industry that I knew I should try to take advantage of. The more I learn and use my skills, the more excited I get about my career and my future to come in tech. I’m looking to join a team where we can collaborate, grow and become the best versions of ourselves.
