# Vision - Bisita.co - 
- One thing we can all agree on, no-one wants to take a trip and have nothing to do. Our goal is to showcase our users a way to plan a trip to Palawan that is easy and free. Operating much like a dating site, we will suggest great locations for our users to come visit. The more you customize your trip, the better we can match places that fit your style. 

## Scope (in/out)
INS
- The website will provide a picture of a destination with a brief description.
- Users can either heart or thumbs down that location, then be shown another location.
- Users will have a list of all their hearted locations.
- Every user can write a review about the destination they went to, the app, anything!

OUTS
- This website will only help people find destinations in the Phillipines. (if popularity grows we expand)
- This is NOT a travel agency or booking site. We will only reccommend hotspot locations to visit.

# MVP
- Display random images, after a user clicks a heart/thumb down the image doesn't show up again.
- After hearting an image, the image is saved to the user profile.
- Users can remove images from their "liked list" profile

## Stretch Goals
- Each image has its own bio that appears on initial image render
- Image displays "Click here to travel to this location", which then loads google maps to that spot
- Customizable user profile
  - Choose an avatar, bio desc, favorite places
- Animation on image render (on heart / thumbdown)
- Form user has to fill out, or page doesn't render
- Chart for destinations. Top places visited/per heart
  - Fourth page, $ spent per place, 
- Adjust the theme of the website, lightmode/darkmode
- Click / hover image to see description
- Review on individual places/images
- If a user hearts the most popular places
  - "You liked a popular destination!"

- Videos for locations, if we can find them.
- Images fall into categories, the more you click images from a category the more that category will be displayed.
